# JSON Content

A Kibana plugin to pretty print JSON strings in the Kibana Discover/Logs tab. This doesn't index the JSON content, it just pretty prints & highlights it in the console for easier reading.

Built for Kibana 8.15.0.

I built this plugin because neither did I want to index the JSON content nor did I want to copy the JSON content to a JSON linter to pretty print it. After hours of searching, I couldn't find any way to pretty print JSONs in the Discover/Logs that did this, so I built one myself. If I missed something obvious, feel free to reach out.

## Installation

The plugin archive is pushed to the `build` folder & committed to the repository (Too lazy to set up a CI/CD pipeline for this).

1. Install in Kibana via:
   ```bash
   bin/kibana-plugin install https://github.com/adiwajshing/kibana-json-content/raw/refs/heads/master/build/jsonContent-8.15.0.zip
   ```
2. If you're running on Kubernetes, you can use [this guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-custom-images.html).

## Usage

1. Open your Discover/Logs tab & select the field you'd like to print as JSON. This must be some string field. See this [guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/8.15/managing-data-views.html#managing-fields)
2. Enable the "Set format", and select JSON:

3. Click save & close the field editor.
4. Now, you can see the JSON content pretty printed in the console!

2. In the Kibana root directory, run `cd plugins`
3. Clone this repository there: `git clone https://github.com/adiwajshing/json-content.git`
4. Switch to this plugin's directory: `cd json-content`
5. Setup the plugin: `yarn bootstrap`
6. Start the dev build: `yarn dev --watch` (watch is optional)
7. To build for production, run: `yarn build`
